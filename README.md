Image fusion in wireless sensor network with trickle dissemination

Image processing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is difficult due to its constraints  in power and processing capability. 
Image fusion is a versatile technique used in  various image processing domains. 

In this project, different image fusion algorithms  were studied, analyzed and picked a suitable algorithm for WSN. 

Implemented this  algorithm in a real time WSN with TI MSP430 processor (Zigbee based). Evaluated the  performance of implemented Algorithms. 

Built with:

Contiki OS, TMote Sky boards
